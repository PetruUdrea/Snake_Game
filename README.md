# Snake_Game
This is a simple snake game developed in Python using object-oriented programming principles and the Turtle Graphics package. This game have 2 game modes.

DEFAULT: When the snake's head contacts any of the four sides in the first game mode—up, down, left, or right—you've lost and the game will immediately restart.
BORDERLESS: Since there are no walls in the second mode, the snake's head will emerge from the opposite side whenever it surpasses one of the four limits (down, right, left, or right). For example, if the snake's head surpasses the right limit, it will emerge from the left in the same direction as before and stay exactly where it was on the vertical axis.

In the main.py file there are instructions to change the game mode from default to borderless.

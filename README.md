# Snake_Game
This is a simple snake game developed in Python using object-oriented programming principles and it has 2 game modes.

The default game mode is the wall mode, which means that when the head of the snake hits the wall you lost and it will automatically reset in the start position.
The 2nd mode doesn't have walls, which means that when the head of the snake exceeds one of the 4 limits (right, up, left, down), it will come out from the oposite side (ex: if the head of the snake exceeds the right limit, it will come from the left in the same direction it was moving and it will remain on the same exact position of the vertical axis)
If you want to play the 2nd mode, you have the indications in the main.py file (in the while loop).
